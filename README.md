# Raspberry-pico-otg
This project is for uploading uf2 files to pico file system from android phones over the USB OTG interface. 

FAT16 file system (which pico emulates) support has been added to the libaums library to acheive this.
Just plug in the pico over OTG and use the app to upload the uf2 file.
Tested on android 12 with pico_w
